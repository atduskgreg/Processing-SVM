# P-SVM: Support Vector Machines for Processing

This is a machine learning library for Processing that uses Support Vector Machines. It is based on the open source [LibSVM](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) project.

It is currently in an early stage. Examples work pretty reliably for 2D numerical data. Helpers coming soon for working with other types and higher dimensional data.

Download [here](https://github.com/downloads/atduskgreg/Processing-SVM/PSVM.zip) to install. See the examples that come with the library for basic training and loading usage.
